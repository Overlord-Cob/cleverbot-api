# cleverbot-api
Python Script to Access Cleverbot

Notes on Usage:
* The optional `headless` parameter alows you to set whether or not a web browser should appear and operate clever bot visibly. This should always be `false` or left to default except when debugging.
* It takes a while for cleverbot to load, typicaly 30 to 60 seconds. Once it has loaded the resources however, you do not have to wait again.
